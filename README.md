### :man_technologist: About Me :
I'm a dedicated Software Engineer at AashOnline. What began as an enriching internship evolved into a full-time role, where I've been contributing my expertise for the past year and a half.

During my internship phase, I delved into diverse projects in web development, spanning eCommerce and food delivery platforms. These experiences honed my skills and provided invaluable insights into crafting user-centric solutions.

Currently, my focus revolves around spearheading projects involving custom products. I'm proud to be part of a team handling substantial traffic while maintaining a robust system, all powered by the versatile MERN stack. It's an exciting challenge that fuels my passion for innovation and scalable solutions.

My academic journey led me through graduation at AKTU, where I cultivated the foundation for my technical prowess and problem-solving abilities.

I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology to create impactful solutions and keen to connect, collaborate, and explore new opportunities within the dynamic realm of software engineering.

Let's connect and engage in discussions on the ever-evolving tech landscape!
